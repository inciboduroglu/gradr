To begin with, some people claim that migrant labor has a positive impact on the economy of the home country. According to these people, laborers invest in improved technology on family farms or set up new enterprises in their home-countries with the money they have earned. However, migration causes a decrease in the number of people living in an area.  Consequently, Labor force decreases and the companies in the home-country collapse, which affects the economy of this country very badly. Secondly, the supporters of labor migration advocate that this movement improves the immigrant’s standard of living. They put this idea forward because in their opinion, labor integration enables people to have a new life in new areas. The migrants also help their relatives to have a higher standard of living. However, there is a point the supporters of this idea are missing. There are hard social consequences of immigration. Firstly, the immigrants are split from their families, a condition which is almost impossible to stand. Moreover, they are thrown into a difficult cultural and linguistic environment which they are totally strange to. Finally, conflicts with host-population occur, which may influence the immigrant’s psychological health badly.
